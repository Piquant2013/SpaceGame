SpaceGame
=========

We have begun working on a new project called SpaceGame, itâ€™s not too far into development as of yet, but we have a start! The game currently consists of a main menu with some very nice music, minimalistic yet neat graphics, a scrolling background, as well as the very first example of simple gameplay with a moveable character along with a camera that follows; and that is all.
We plan to expand upon this prototype and push features into the game, until it fully meets our goals and expectations of ourselves, which are by no means short sighted.
If you wish to download the very barebones of our project, please use the links below, if you find any bugs at all with the current build, as simple as it may be, it is better to catch even the smallest of bugs as soon as possible. We rely greatly on the communities feedback, suggestions and reports of bugs.
